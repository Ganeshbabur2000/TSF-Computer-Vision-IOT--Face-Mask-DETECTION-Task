# TSF-Computer-Vision-IOT--Face-Mask-DETECTION-Task

Here is the code of the project am working on!
Project Name : Face Mask Detection 

I ve Provided a dataset which cosist of two folder    1. with mask     - it consist Images of people wearing mask ; 
                                                      2. without mask  - it consist Images of people not wearing the mask ;
                                                      

Here there are 2 codes given    1. Code to Train the Model
                                2. Code to make use of model that is trained to detect face mask .
                                
                                
For convenient purpose I ve added both codes in the same file and exceuted the code in Jupyter Note book.                                

The steps to exceuted the code is as follows: 

 1.Change the location of directory of dataset in the first code, Makesure both the code and dataset are present in the same directory. 
 
 2. Run the First code to train the model.The output of this step is the plot which shows     1.accuracy ;
                                                                                              2. Loss ;
                                                                                              3.valuse accuracy ;
                                                                                              4.value loss ;
3. Run the 2nd code once the model is trained . The ouput is that video stream turns on and detects the face mask

once You ve trained the model there is no requriment to train the model again and again whenever you bwant  to excetue the code .
