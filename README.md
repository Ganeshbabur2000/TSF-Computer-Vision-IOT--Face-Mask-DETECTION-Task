# TSF-Computer-Vision-IOT--Face-Mask-DETECTION-Task

Here is the code of the project am working on!
Project Name : Face Mask Detection 

I ve Provided a dataset which cosist of two folder    
1. with mask     - it consist Images of people wearing mask.
2. without mask  - it consist Images of people not wearing the mask.
                                                      


Here there are 2 codes given    
1. Code to Train the Model
2. Code to make use of model that is trained to detect face mask .
             
             
                                
For convenient purpose I ve added both codes in the same file and exceuted the code in Jupyter Note book with the required Libraries to be installed.                                

The steps to exceute the code is as follows: 

1. Install or check the requied Libraries present in the Jupyter Notebook.

2. Change the location of the directory of dataset in the first code, Makesure both the code and dataset are present in the same folder. 
 
3. Run the First code to train the model. The output will be the graphical representation of the analysis which shows
a) accuracy.
b) Loss.
c) value accuracy.
d) value loss.

4. Run the 2nd code once the model is trained. Additional window will be opened as the ouput, which streams the live video of the user and detects the face with mask or without mask.


NOTE: Once the model is trained it is not necessary to train the model again. 2nd code can be directly excetue whenever requied.
